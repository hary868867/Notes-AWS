AWS DevOps

Autoscaling - autoscaling is used to monitor and compute the resources automatically so that the applications hosted in AWS maintain a good performance, it will scale in or scale out the resources based on the criteria for eg; CPU utilization
while creating autoscaling group we have to create cloudwatch alarms 

how to create Autoscaling group -
first, we have to create launch template
then, we have to create target groups & a load balancer ( application ) ... auto scaling group automatically adds instance to the target groups 
now, go to auto scaling group, give all the parameters needed, select the launch template & target groups.. 

auto scaling group will create the instances based on the launch templates, so whatever parameters we need to change, we need to change in launch templates
the instances created auto scaling group are dynamic, means they can be deleted anytime based on performance, so we need to store our data somehwere outside, i.e, EFS or anything

command to install aws cli - apt install aws cli -y ( ubuntu )
