AWS DevOps - Mike Pfifer ( Plural Sight ) 


open the browser.. download git for windows-> put use powershell as option.. rest all are defaults.. finish downloading it.
we need .net sdk for AWS.. so go to browser & download aws tools for windows by clicking aws.amazon.com/powershell/.. all are defaults, finsih setup.

now, go to aws console, create new user, save credentials.. give him awscodecommitfullaccess permission
now, get to powershell.. type command - Set-AWSCredentials -AccessKey giveacceskey -SecretKey givesecretkey -StoreAs codecommit
now go to- cd '.\Program Files\aws tools\code commit-> do ls.. you will find, git-credential file-> now run command- .\git file.exe -p profilename - here, profilename is codecommit which we gave in above command... thats it, our credentials are fully configured.

so, after all this configuration, code commit works just as git & the commands we use are nothing but the git commands
